B.F.P.O.
Army dreamers
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O.
Mammy's hero
Our little army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.
I've a bunch of purple flowers
To decorate mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
The weather warmer, he is colder
Four men in uniform
To carry home my little soldier
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
(What could he do?)
(Should have been a politician)
But he never had a proper education
(What could he do?)
(Should have been a father)
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste
Army dreamers
Oh, what a waste of
Army (army) dreamers (dreamers)
Tears o'er a tin box
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
(What could he do?)
(Should have been a politician)
But he never had a proper education
(What could he do?)
(Should have been a father)
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste
Army dreamers
Ooh, what a waste of
Army (army) dreamers (dreamers)
Ooh, what a waste of all them
Army (army) dreamers (dreamers)
Army (army) dreamers (dreamers)
Army (army) dreamers (dreamers), oh
B.F.P.O.
Army dreamers
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O.
Army dreamers
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O.
No hard heroes
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O.
Army dreamers
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O.
